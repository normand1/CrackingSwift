# CrackingSwift
Answers to common Swift coding questions

I'm doing some studying about Swift and Algorithms. I thought it might be helpful to share my studies online. I'm using a popular book to do my studies. If you'd like to follow along or even help to solve many of the problems in swift I'd welcome your pull request.

I'm using playgrounds for now as it seems like the most useful for studying algorithms, but I may expand to standard swift classes later depending on the algorithms I am trying to solve. Currently I plan on using different playgrounds for different chapters. I will differentiate between different questions via inline comments.

I hope you find this useful.
